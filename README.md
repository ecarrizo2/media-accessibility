This project is meant to be a POC for the following tools:

- Using SST/Ion for Infrastructure as a code and Resource management such as API and Queues Routing, SSL, DNS, etc
- Using TSyringe for Dependency Injection without having to use a framework like NestJS
- Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD

This project in particular solves a problem for some of my other side projects
which is to provide a way to analyse images and create speech from these analysed images description,
the goal is to be using the generated data to add accessibility features to my other projects.
